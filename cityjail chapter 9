FROM criminals c
JOIN crimes cr ON  cr.criminal_id= c.criminal_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN appeals a ON cr.crime_id = a.crime_id;

3. List all criminals along with crime information. The report needs to include the criminal ID, name, crime classification, date charged, crime code, and fine amount. Include only crimes classified as “Other.” Sort the list by criminal ID and date charged.

FROM criminals c
JOIN crimes cr ON cr.criminal_id = c.criminal_id
JOIN crime_charges ch ON ch.crime_id= cr.crime_id
WHERE cr.classification = ‘O’
ORDER BY c.criminal_id, cr.date_charged;
